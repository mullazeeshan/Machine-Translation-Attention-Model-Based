# Machine-Translation-Attention-Model-Based
Machine translation to convert human readable dates to machine readable dates. (MT) refers to fully automated software that can translate source content into target content of different type. Neural Machine Translation is method which utilizes neural networks to achieve this task.
## Inspired from the final week assignment in Angrew Ng's Deep Learning Specialization Course.

A Simple Way but tough Approach:

## About
Machine translation (MT) refers to fully automated software that can translate source content into target content of different type. Humans may use MT to help them render text and speech into another language, or the MT software may operate without human intervention. Neural Machine Translation is method which utilizes neural networks to achieve this task.

## Diagram of Attention Mechanism
Diagram below on the left shows attention model in one view. The diagram on the left shows one step attention mechanism. Please refer to this [blog](https://sorenbouma.github.io/blog/oneshot/) for detailed description.
